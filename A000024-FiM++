Dear PPCG: I solved A000024!

I learned how to party to get a number using the number x and the number y.
Did you know that the number beers was x?
For every number chug from 1 to y,
  beers became beers times x!
That's what I did.
Then you get beers!
That's all about how to party.

Today I learned how to do math to get a number using the number n.
Did you know that the number answer was 0?
For every number x from 1 to n,
  For every number y from 1 to n,
    Did you know that the number tmp1 was how to party using x and 2?
    Did you know that the number tmp2 was how to party using y and 2?
    Did you know that the number max was how to party using 2 and n?
    tmp2 became tmp2 times 10!
    tmp1 became tmp1 plus tmp2!
    If tmp1 is more than max then: answer got one more.
  That's what I did.
That's what I did.
Then you get answer!
That's all about how to do math.

Your faithful student, BlackCap.
